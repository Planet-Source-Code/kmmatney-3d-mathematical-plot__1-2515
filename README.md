## 3D Mathematical Plot


</div>

### Description

This project shows how to take any custom equation that is a function of X and Y, and plot it in a picture box. The plot is a rudimentary 2D colored contour plot, but it does look pretty. This project has several useful components:

1) An equation parser class with built-in error checking

2) Color mixing algorithms with a customized interface

3) Shows how to plot XYZ values in a picture box

Cool stuff...
 
### More Info
 
Just download the project and run it.
